## Overview

<img src="img1_readme.png" alt="eample phone image" width="400" height="500">

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a deep convolutional neural network model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously in the simulator with the vehicle remaining on the road throughout

More information about this project is provided in the [report](https://github.com/girishpai/CarND_BehavClone/blob/master/Writeup_report.pdf).

### Dependencies
This project requires:
